This shell is my third semester assigment for my Operating Systems course at university. It is not intended to be a full-featured shell, just one that provides the most basic, and less, such as executing an executable (with a relative or absolute path) with arguments, and optionally be able to deal with pipes, background tasks and such.

“P8“ stands for “Paris 8”, the short name for “Université Paris 8 Vincennes-Saint-Denis”.
